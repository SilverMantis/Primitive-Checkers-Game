# Primitive Checkers Game
A simple checkers game I made in python with tkinter to improve on my GUI and OOP skills!

## Differences

The main and practically only difference this checkers app/game contains is the fact that if a piece can consume multiple pieces at the same time, it will do so, and duplicate, originally this was a glitch but I liked it so I kept it in as a feature
